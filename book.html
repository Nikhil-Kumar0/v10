            It's incredible to think how, <b><i>just a few days or one and half a year ago, we dont know each other.</i></b> I didn't even
            know you. Meeting you through [platform] was a moment of fate that
            I'll always be grateful for. At first, I wasn't sure how we'd
            connect, what we'd talk about, or what kind of person you'd be. But
            now, after spending time with you, I've realized something truly
            special— You're absolutely amazing. 💖 Your words, your kindness,
            and the way you make me smile have already made a place in my heart.
            I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can't imagine
            not having you in my life. Maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was
            just luck—but whatever it was, I'm glad it brought me to you. 💕

            and it makes you absolutely perfect in every way. But beyond your
            beauty, it's your kindness and the way you make others feel special
            that truly set you apart. You radiate positivity, and your energy is
            something rare and precious. No matter where you are or what you do,

            I am really thankful to you for teaching me how to treat a girl, or in be relationship.
            Cause I was a very shy person and I don't know how to talk to girls and I don't know how to treat a girl in a relationship. Also I don't know how to be a good boyfriend. By just being with you I learn a lot of things about girls and relationship. And I am really thankful to you for that. I will never forget the things you taught me. And I will implement those things in my life when I will be in a relationship, just after leaving this university. <b>Thanks to you now I think I will treat a girl who will be very special to me. And I will do everything for her and I will be a good boyfriend to her.</b>
